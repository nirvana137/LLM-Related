    "Steps \n",
    "Step One: We admitted we were powerless over our addiction—that our lives had become unmanageable.\n",
    "Step Two: Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.\n",
    "Step Three: Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of a higher power as we understood Him.\n",
    "Step Four: Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.\n",
    "Step Five: Admitted to a higher power, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.\n",
    "Step Six: Were entirely ready to have a higher power remove all these defects of character.\n",
    "Step Seven: Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.\n",
    "Step Eight: Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.\n",
    "Step Nine: Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.\n",
    "Step Ten: Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.\n",
    "Step Eleven: Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with a higher power as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.\n",
    "Step Twelve: Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditions\n",
    "Tradition One: Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon unity.\n",
    "Tradition Two: For our group purpose, there is but one ultimate authority—a loving God as He may express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they do not govern.\n",
    "Tradition Three: The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop the addictive behavior.\n",
    "Tradition Four: Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or the entire fellowship.\n",
    "Tradition Five: Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the addict who still suffers.\n",
    "Tradition Six: A group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the group name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property, and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.\n",
    "Tradition Seven: Every group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.\n",
    "Tradition Eight: The group should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service centers may employ special workers.\n",
    "Tradition Nine: The group as such ought never be organized, but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.\n",
    "Tradition Ten: The group has no opinion on outside issues; hence the group name ought never be drawn into public controversy.\n",
    "Tradition Eleven: Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films.\n",
    "Tradition Twelve: Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.\n",

    "Promises\n",

    "Promise Two: We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.\n",
    "Promise Three: We will comprehend the word serenity.\n",
    "Promise Four: We will know peace.\n",
    "Promise Five: No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others.\n",
    "Promise Six: That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.\n",
    "Promise Seven: We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.\n",
    "Promise Eight: Self-seeking will slip away.\n",
    "Promise Nine: Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.\n",
    "Promise Ten: Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.\n",
    "Promise Eleven: We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.\n",
    "Promise Twelve: We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.\n",
